***********************************

let(:car) { Car.new }
let(:subject) { Car.new }
# this is so common that rspec provides a shortcut for this

subject {Car.new}

it "allows reading for :wheels" do
  expect(subject.wheels).to eq(4)
end

just like let it can be eager executed with
subject!

# Subject's main goal is to make subject stand out.
